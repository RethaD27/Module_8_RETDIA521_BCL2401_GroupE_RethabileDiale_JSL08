# [JSL08] Submission: Singleton Pattern for Bank Branch Management

## Introduction:
This project uses JavaScript classes to construct a BankBranch Singleton Management System. It guarantees that the BankBranch class is constructed and shared by the application as a single instance.

## Project Overview:
* HTML('index.html'): This file defines the structure of the web page. It includes links to external CSS and JavaScript files.
* CSS('index.css'): The CSS file contains styles to reset default styles, set the background image, and style the 'h1' element.
* JavaScript('index.js'): The JavaScript file defines the BankBranch class for managing branch information. It implements the Singleton design pattern to ensure that only one instance of the BankBranch class is created.

## Usage:
* Clone or download the project repository to your local machine.
* Open the 'index.html' file in a web browser to view the web page.
* Use the browser console to interact with the BranchBranch Singleton Management System. Instances of the BankBranch class('branchA' and 'branchB') are created with different branch information.
  
## Technologies Used:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

# Reflection

## Challenges Faced:
* Understanding Singleton Pattern
* Scope Management

## Lessons Learned:
* Singleton Implementation
* Class Definition and Method Creation
* Instance Management

# Conclusion:
The Bank Branch Singleton provided valuable insights into implementing design patterns in JavaScript , specifically the singleton pattern. It enhanced proficiency in object-oriented programming concepts and laid the foundation for building more complex and scalable applications in the future.
